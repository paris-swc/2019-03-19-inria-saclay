Dear fellow Software carpenter,

the Software carpentry workshop is going to happen next week (Monday 19 and
Tuesday 20 March) in Inria Saclay (more details at
https://paris-swc.github.io/2019-03-19-inria-saclay/).

Here are a few things you need to do before the workshop.

Please fill out the pre-workshop survey
(https://carpentries.typeform.com/to/wi32rS?slug=2019-03-19-inria-saclay).
This is useful for the instructors to have a quick idea about the audience and
helps Software Carpentry workshops to get better with time.

As a reminder: participants must bring a laptop with a Mac, Linux, or Windows
operating system (not a tablet, Chromebook, etc.) and make sure that you have
administrative privileges on.

- there is a few things you need to install before the workshop, go to
  https://paris-swc.github.io/2019-03-19-inria-saclay/#setup, click on your
  Operating System (Windows, MacOS or Linux) and follow the installation
  instructions for the "The Bash shell", "Git" and "Python".

- you will also need to download a few files. Please follow the instruction for
  Bash (http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html) and Python
  (http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup/).

If you encounter problems when following these install instructions, we
recommend that you arrive before the beginning of the workshop on Tuesday
morning. Some of us will be there from 8.30am to help with installation issues.

We hope to see you all this Tuesday 19th at Alan Turing,
Software Carpentry Paris
